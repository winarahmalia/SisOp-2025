### 1.1 What are the three main purposes of an operating system?
**Answer:**  
- Provides a platform where users can run programs in a convenient and efficient manner.  
- Acts as a communication bridge (interface) between user and computer hardware.  
- Prevents unauthorized access to important programs and user data.

---

### 1.2 When is it appropriate for the operating system to "waste" resources? Why is such a system not really wasteful?
**Answer:**  
- To improve security (at the cost of memory and CPU overhead).  
- In interactive systems (desktops, laptops, smartphones) where quick response is more important than efficiency.  
- In time-sharing systems, where processes are scheduled for user responsiveness rather than maximum efficiency.

---

### 1.3 Main difficulty in writing an OS for a real-time environment?
**Answer:**  
Ensuring all critical tasks/processes meet strict deadlines. Missing deadlines can cause the system to fail in critical applications (medical, aviation, automotive). Programmers must handle real-time scheduling, efficient resource management, and fast interrupt handling while ensuring deterministic behavior.

---

### 1.4 Should the OS include applications like web browsers and mail programs?
**Answer:**  
- **Should:** Convenience for users (e.g., Windows with Edge, macOS with Safari).  
- **Should not:** Modular design (many Linux distributions provide only core OS, allowing users to install apps they need).

---

### 1.5 How does kernel mode vs user mode provide rudimentary protection?
**Answer:**  
- In user mode, each process gets its own address space.  
- In kernel mode, the OS has full access to system hardware and critical data.  
- This separation ensures user programs cannot directly access or modify system-critical resources.

### 1.6 Which of the following instructions should be privileged?
| Instruction | Privileged? |
|---|---|
| a. Set value of timer | ✔️ |
| b. Read the clock | ❌ |
| c. Clear memory | ✔️ |
| d. Issue a trap instruction | ❌ |
| e. Turn off interrupts | ✔️ |
| f. Modify entries in device-status table | ✔️ |
| g. Switch from user to kernel mode | ✔️ |
| h. Access I/O device | ✔️ |

---

### 1.7 Difficulties with early OS protection schemes (fixed memory partition)?
**Answer:**  
- Bug fixes require full system shutdown and hardware replacement.  
- Hard to adapt system configuration to hardware/user needs.

---

### 1.8 Uses for more than two modes of operation?
**Answer:**  
- **User mode:** Controlled by user applications.  
- **Kernel/system mode:** Controlled by OS.  
- Other modes could provide more granular privileges for different types of system processes (e.g., drivers).

---

### 1.9 How to compute current time with a timer?
**Answer:**  
- System timer increments at a fixed frequency (e.g., 1000 ticks per second).  
- OS tracks ticks since a known start time.  
- Current time = ticks × time per tick.

---

### 1.10 Reasons why caches are useful (and their problems)?
**Answer:**  
- **Benefits:** Faster data access, reduces bandwidth by caching frequently used data.  
- **Problems:** High cost if cache size approaches full device size, not practical for all data, only effective for "hot" data.

---

### 1.11 Client-server vs peer-to-peer models?
| Model | Description |
|---|---|
| Peer-to-peer | Direct communication between computers, low cost, suitable for small networks. |
| Client-server | Central server manages communication and storage, scalable, but requires higher server specs. |
